# Twin-B_Model
An agent-based building simulation platform using Mesa and EnergyPlus to study occupant behavior and indoor climate control. It leverages PyTorch for fast vectorized computation, torch.distributed for parallel scenario evaluation, and manages outputs and parameters via CSV and config.yaml for scalability and extensibility.
